# Contributing to the Repository

We welcome contributions to the repository! Of course, your contributions will be credited. If you’d like to add solutions in a language of your choice, or amend an existing solution in any language, here’s how you can contribute.

1. Let me know what you plan to contribute! The best way to do this is by joining our discord server (see page 2 of the book). Communication is important to prevent you labouring on a set of quesitons that someone's already working on.

2. Once you've been approved, **fork the repository** to start working on your own solutions locally.

3. Take a close look at how the Python solutions are organized. Your contributions should align with this structure (e.g., folder organization, file naming). 

4. Always **create a new branch** for your additions or changes. We recommend creating separate branches for each chapter or feature you’re contributing. Example: `git checkout -b java-solutions-linked-lists`.

5. Stay true to existing code comments and structure. Feel free to add additional comments for clarity, especially if any language-specific nuances are included.

6. **Test your code**. Be sure your code runs. We're currently working on making all test cases public. In the mean time, please use your own set of diverse test cases.

7. **Open a pull request** (PR) and clearly describe your work in the PR. Respond to comments and make necessary adjustments when requested. Once approved, your PR will be merged!
